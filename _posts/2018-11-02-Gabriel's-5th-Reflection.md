This week was great in apcsp.
On Monday we learned about Boolean punnet squares, we also learned about how to place certain data into the correct catagory. Another thing we did was try to create a score board between the Dodgers and the Red Sox. However to do that we needed to create a test case, which is something I don't know how to do. Hopefully I'll try to learn it in the coming weeks.
Wednesday is half of the biggest thing we tackled this week. Contracts. We were assigned to 15 word problems, on a starter file which can be found on google classroom. We had to define functions and put the contracts with said definitions. I forgot how to write contracts so I tried to make up the format, I think I accidentally made a test case since it looks like the mini-sheet we recieved on Monday. I think we may review this on thursday since it was about half of the work to put in contracts. I got pretty far into completing it, I got stuck on multiplicative inverse, since I searched it up it only said x/1, I put that but it doesn't feel right to me. This here is a definition of a function called double.
```
fun double(x): (x * 2) end
 
```
I was right about Thursday. We did review on contracts. We also learned the difference between a contract and a definition. Something I said must have been good, since Mr.Alatta decided that he should use that to help explain how contracts work more in-depth to my friend Junior. A contract is a non-specific type of data. It's generic, and it shows what the function will do. But a definition is very specific and it's important to have accuracy. A definition is HOW a function will do what you want it to do. To me this seems very interesting.
