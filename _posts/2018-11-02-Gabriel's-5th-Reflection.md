This week was great in apcsp.
On Monday we learned about Boolean punnet squares, we also learned about how to place certain data into the correct catagory. Another thing we did was try to create a score board between the Dodgers and the Red Sox. However to do that we needed to create a test case, which is something I don't know how to do. Hopefully I'll try to learn it in the coming weeks.
Wednesday is half of the biggest thing we tackled this week. Contracts. We were assigned to 15 word problems, on a starter file which can be found on google classroom. We had to define functions and put the contracts with said definitions. I forgot how to write contracts so I tried to make up the format, I think I accidentally made a test case since it looks like the mini-sheet we recieved on Monday. I think we may review this on thursday since it was about half of the work to put in contracts. I got pretty far into completing it, I got stuck on multiplicative inverse, since I searched it up it only said x/1, I put that but it doesn't feel right to me. This here is a definition of a function called double.
```
fun double(x): (x * 2) end
 
```
