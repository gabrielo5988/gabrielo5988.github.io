This week in  APCSP was pretty cool. Monday through wednesday we did learning on pair programming. I learned specifically that I forgot how most of this works over the break, which is reasonable since all I did was play. But I mdigress. Thursday and Friday we applied what we learned in trying to make a background rectangle and a circle in Pyret. My partner was Noah and I think we did well, despite a few bumps we both did good on the driver-navigator partnership. I'm excited for what's next.
