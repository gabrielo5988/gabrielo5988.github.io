This week we continued our flags and I made signifigant progress. This is it here. ![My New Flag](/images/usa.png)
I had a lot of trouble with the stripes because no matter what I tried the stripe kept going over the blue corner. My idea was to expand the corner so it can give the illusion that the stripe begins sepereatley from the origin. It workes too! Now my new challenge is to get stars on the blue and have a flag that is the embodiment of patriotism.
