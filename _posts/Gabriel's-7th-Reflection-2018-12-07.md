This week was about flags. The flag I am going to be making is the United states flag, I made a collage of it with white paper as my background and I wanted to make red stripes that were a little bit over a centimeter wide. I chose this flag because it would give me a professional, for practitioner I could have made the Norway flag. I wanted to make the usa flag to feel more patriotic and to celebreate the new controversial game Fallout:76. My flag is a 3:4 ratio, being 20 cm wide and 15 cm high. I will have 7 red stripes and 6 white stripes. i think I'm gonna do good for this project
