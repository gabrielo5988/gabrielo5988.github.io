This week was good in apcsp. On Monday we were looking at tables, This was interesting because Pyret is similar to Racket Code, I wonder if the code to make a table on Racket Code is very similar seeing as how Mr. Alatta gave us a paper, that more or less was like a translator. It was nice to get something going again, I like to code, so I think this will go well.
Wednesday was the 2nd or 3rd time Mr. Alatta gave us a homework assignment. It was about making the same table on the starter file from Monday, but we were to expand upon it, I gave it a new column and it was to see if it was round. I added a triangle, a square, a rectangle, a circle, and an ellipse. I then had to use Booleans, which hits a bit of nostalgia from Computational Algebra, where we made a game with Racket Code. I learned that Pyret is easy to understand and to type. But it's specifications make it very tedious, for me at least.
Thursday we had to add another column, but this time we had a twist. I never had to add an image to a table before, but I guess that this is an opportunity to learn new things. That's why I'm here, I add
