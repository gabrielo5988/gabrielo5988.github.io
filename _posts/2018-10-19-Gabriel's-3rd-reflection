This week was pretty cool. 
On Monday we learned how to get to shapes to overlap one on top of another, in Pyret. I learned that the coding between Pyret and Racket Code is nearly identical, maybe it was a major influence. Not to mention it's high demand of specification, yet simplicity.
On Wednesday we finally finished our flags, we are supposed to turn them in on thursday, My flag is the peruvian flag because it's where my family is from, I also had some trouble figuring out how to get images to overlap, but I think I got it down.
Thursday we had to put an image in our blog post, I learned how to download one from pyret, the image is my real flag.arr I had to create a new directory called images in order to actually be able to get them on my github blog. This is it so far, I plan to add the details later.  ![My flag](peru.png)
