This week seemed pretty weird for me. On monday we started with the old drone delivery program from early October, Mr. Alatta asked us to try and get the box to land in the "Delivery Zone", He also asked us to ask questions on the new google classroom discussion based on the program. Mr. Alatta called it DeliveryState, he seems to make the titles of his functions straightforward to what exactly they do. It looked like this ```fun next-position(x, y):
  y - 5``` I didn't really get it because now that I look at it again after some time, I noticed that I kept playing with the exanmples and not the actual function, Hindsight really is 20/20.
 On Wednesday we took a bit of a sweet tooth because we began working on functions involving cakes we had to add in our own cakes into the functions. I added italian rainbow cake because it's an old favorite. Something I noticed is that Mr.Alatta made sure have us create contracts for this program, I understand why since I am still struggling with them, I think I am getting better. We also tried to  fix the taller-than and the will-melt functions. I couldn't get them to work though.
 Thursday was when things got weird for me, it's not that I don't understand any of it, I am a little confused because I kept getting errors once I began to use the ```.flavors``` dot accessors. It also said that it had to be in a check box but it was already in one so I was very confused as to what I could do, so I played around with it but no luck in getting it to work. At the end of the class I ended up with this ```fun taller-than(birthday-cake, red-velvet-cake):
 check:
  taller-than(birthday-cake, red-velvet-cake)
      is trued
    is birthday-cake.layers >
    ...red-velvet-cake.layers
end
``` I'll try to work on it, I want to pass this course. but I want to pass with flying colors. I will be trying a lot harder thanks to this new-born ambition. Hopefully it will take me far later in life. 
Today is Friday and I am writing this reflection, I still have some things to take care of in the cake program so I think I'll work on that
