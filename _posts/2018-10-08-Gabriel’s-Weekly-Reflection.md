This week an AP comp was pretty cool. On Monday we went on a site to find color palletes, we then had to list their values and their name. 
On Wednesday we went to fotw.info to find flags with stripes and discuss how we could input said stripes on pyret.
Thursday and Friday we have taken more looks at flags and on Friday we chose a flag, I chose peru because it's where most of my family is from, we then made it with paper scraps to show how we could do the same using pyret
